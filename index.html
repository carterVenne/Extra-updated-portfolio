        <p class="indexP">I am a full stack web developer with a hard work ethic and ability to adapt. Working to receive a certificate in web development from the University of Minnesota, equipped with an arsenal of skills in HTML, Javascript, CSS, and responsive design. I have a simple goal with everything I design: make it react intuitively to users and function accessible across all platforms. In a recent project I utilized server-side APIs along with localstorage and aforementioned programming languages to create a weather finding application. I look forward to utilizing my skill set for developing and maintaining websites.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indexP">I grew up in Minnesota, spending most of my childhood in New Hope. Growing up with two older brothers(and now two older step-brothers to add in the mix) made me competitive, always trying my best to do as well as they did in school and sports. Growing up I played every sport from soccer, to football, to hockey. These days I spend the winter months still playing ice hockey when I can, while the summer is spent on disc golf, and I try to hike and stay active year round.</p>

        <p class="indexP"> After graduating from Cooper High School, I spent a year at North Hennepin Community College trying to navigate my way through life's ups and downs. Working retail for several years and several companies I started to realize that profession was not where my passions lie. Experiencing the volatile and uncertain work world with the Covid virus I decided it was time for a change. Since a young age I've had an affinity for technology, spending countless hours on the family desktop researching and playing video games. So naturally after experimenting with coding in high school and looking into various bootcamps I decided to move into the web development field. Utilizing the skills I learn in this bootcamp I look forward to the next building block of my future success.</p>
